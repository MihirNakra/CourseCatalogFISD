To Students and Families: 
 
This Academic Guide & Course Catalog has been developed to provide important information for 
students. It will assist students and families in making wise, informed decisions concerning programs 
and course choices throughout your high school years. 
 
The goal of Frisco Independent School District is to prepare students as thoroughly as possible for the 
next phase of their lives. This guide contains important information to help direct the student in making 
informed decisions throughout high school: 

 
■  Section I: Academic Guide contains information on grade classifications, graduation 
programs, class rank, academic programming, transcripts, and other academic topics.  

 
■  Section II: Course Catalog lists the courses that our high schools generally make available to 
students. However, it should be noted that not all of the courses listed are offered every year at 
every high school. Sufficient numbers of student requests for specific courses, staffing, and 
other factors impact whether or not a course is scheduled. All course offerings are subject to 
change. Please refer to the counseling office at your respective high school for more detailed 
information during the course selection process. 
 

Your school counselors and other campus staff provide invaluable insight and guidance in your 
decision-making processes. The Academic Guide is a general reference guide only and should not be 
considered comprehensive. Please be aware that it is not a complete statement of all policies, 
procedures, or rules that may be applicable in a given circumstance. If you or your child have questions 
about any of the material in this handbook, please contact your campus Administration. 
 
■  Frisco Independent School District does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, 

national origin, sex or disability in providing education or providing access to benefits of education 
services, activities, and programs, including career and technology programs, in accordance with 
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; 
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; and Title II of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act. 
 

■  The Texas Education Agency and the Texas State Board of Education often update information, 

especially in the areas of assessment, accountability, and graduation plans. The information in this 
guide is accurate as of the time it went to print.   This document is updated as information becomes 
available. 

This guide is intended as a reference and does not replace policy. Any extenuating 
circumstances are determined at the discretion of the principal.

Graduation Programs and Requirements 
 
Foundation High School Program and Endorsements 
House Bill 5 was signed into law in the summer of 2013 and applies to all students entering high 
school during the 2014-15 school year and thereafter. House Bill 5 established a single 
graduation program, the Foundation High School Program (FHSP). Students will also have the 
opportunity to build on the FHSP by earning Endorsements, Performance Acknowledgements, 
and a Distinguished Level of Achievement. Students will need to declare their preferred 
endorsement area, in writing, by the beginning of their 9th grade year. Students have 
opportunities to change endorsement areas during the time of course selection every year; see 
counselor for information. 
 
An endorsement can be earned by taking additional courses in Career and Technical Education (CTE) 
or by taking additional non-CTE courses specified within the endorsement requirements. 
The endorsement areas are as follows: 

●  Arts & Humanities 
●  Business & Industry 
●  Multidisciplinary 
●  Public Service 
●  Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) 

 
FISD offers courses to meet endorsements in all areas. There are specific course requirements 
in the foundation curriculum based on the Endorsement selected; however, most students meet 
the requirement of multiple endorsements without making a special effort to do so.  Students 
should select electives that will best prepare the student for the post-secondary goals they aim to 
pursue.   
 
A student may elect to graduate without an endorsement under the high school foundation 
program with school administrator approval after the student’s sophomore year.  The student and 
the student’s parent or guardian must be advised by the school administration of the benefits of 
graduating with one or more endorsement and the student’s parent or guardian must file written 
permission with the high school allowing the student to graduate without an endorsement. 
 
Students who meet the minimum requirements of the local FISD graduation program under EIF 
Local will meet the requirements of the Distinguished Level of Achievement. 
 
More detailed information about the graduation programs and endorsements may be found 
at: 
http://www.friscoisd.org/departments/guidance-and-counseling/academic-advisement/graduation-plans  
Distinguished Level of Achievement (DLA) (26 credits) 
The Distinguished Level of Achievement (DLA) is the highest graduation program in the state of Texas.  
The Foundation High School Program + Endorsement with DLA is the default for all FISD students. 
 
A student may earn a Distinguished Level of Achievement by successfully completing the curriculum 
required for the Foundation Program and successfully completing the following: 
 

o  The curriculum requirements for one or more Endorsement(s) to include a coherent 

sequence of courses that are content specific to the chosen endorsement 

 

 

o 

 Additional coursework to include: 

●  Four credits in mathematics, including Algebra II 
●  Four credits in approved science courses

Foundation High School Program + Endorsement (26 credits) 
Endorsements are described in detail in the “Frisco ISD Graduation Guide for the Class of 2018 & 
Beyond”  
 
This guide includes core course requirements by endorsement, sample four-year graduation programs, 
and Frisco ISD course offerings by endorsement.  The curriculum requirements for earning an 
endorsement require a student to meet and exceed the Foundation Program and successfully 
completing the following: 
 

o  The curriculum requirements for one or more endorsement(s) to include a coherent 

sequence of courses that are content specific to the chosen endorsement 

 

o 

 Additional coursework to include 

●  Four credits in mathematics  
●  Four credits in approved science courses  

 
Note:  The  only  difference  between  the  FHSP+Endorsement  Program  and the  DLA  is the  requirement 
that Algebra II must be one of the four credits in mathematics. 
 
Foundation High School Program (FHSP) (25 credits) 
This option is the minimum graduation program available. However, it is not available until after the 
completion of the sophomore year. Changing to this graduation program will require parent and 
administrative approval in writing. Parents and students need to understand graduating on this program 
may not meet college or university entrance requirements. 
 
Early Graduation 
Students interested in early graduation should see their counselor. All high school students who apply 
to graduate early must complete the requirements for the Frisco ISD Foundation High School 
Graduation Program plus endorsement unless the student, the student’s parent/guardian and a school 
administrator agree in writing that there are extenuating circumstances or extreme hardships.  If an 
agreement is reached, then the student will be allowed to graduate under the Foundation High School 
Program and will adhere to the requirements outlined in Education Code 28.025(b), (b-7).  A 
declaration of intent to graduate early must be filed after May 1 of the second year of high school but 
prior to December 1 of the third year.  Requests made after December 1 will be considered for approval 
by the Superintendent or his designee.

Endorsement Pathways 
The endorsement pathways listed below are for illustration purposes. Students do not need to take 
every course listed under each sequence, nor are these prescribed sequences for students – these are 
recommended sequences only.  There are many options in each endorsement and in each pathway.  
The default graduation plan for all FISD students leads to the Distinguished Level of Achievement, 
which requires Alg. II to be in the math sequence of the student’s endorsement plan.  
 

ARTS & HUMANITIES ENDORSEMENT 
Unless noted, this endorsement can be earned with 4 credits in a coherent sequence.  Please view the FISD 
Course Catalog for prerequisites and other specifics.

Grading & Grade Point Average (GPA) 
There are two different grade point averages (or GPAs) that are calculated for each high school 
student. The unweighted GPA (often referred to as teh ”college” GPA) is a traditional GPA based on a 
4.0 scale where all courses are counted equally. Colleges are easily able to compare this type of GPA 
from districts across the nation.The GPA for Rank or weighted GPA is based on a 6.0 scale where 
different courses carry different weights. The State of Texas requires public schools to publish the rank 
for the top 10% of students in each class. In Texas, students who are in the top 10% of their graduating 
class receive automatic admission to any public university or college in Texas, with the exception of the 
University of Texas. Students in the top 6% of their graduating class of 2022 receive automatic 
admission to the University of Texas. 
 
Weighted GPA 
Both the unweighted GPA and the weighted GPA are posted on a student’s transcript. Rank in class, 
honor graduate status, valedictorian and salutatorian determination shall be based on a weighted GPA 
system.  Grade points shall be based on semester grades for courses taken for high school credit.  The 
GPA shall be computed to three decimal places.  The third quarter marking period shall count as a 
semester grade for purposes of determining rank, honor graduate status, valedictorian, and salutatorian 
for seniors. Dual credit grades shall not be recorded at the third marking period and the first semester 
grade will count for purposes of determining rank, honor graduate status, valedictorian, and 
salutatorian.  
 
Rank in class will only be published for students in the top 10% of their class at the end of each 
semester. The lowest-weighted GPA of seniors in the top 10 percent, first quartile, second quartile, and 
third quartile will be published in the Student Portal after each calculation period, so students will know 
generally where they fall in relation to their peers. Information for juniors, sophomores and freshmen 
will be published only in February and June. 
 
GPA for Rank Excluded Courses 
For the graduating classes of 2021 and 2022, all high school credit courses taken during the regular 
school year shall count toward the unweighted GPA and weighted GPA except the following:  

•  Courses that are Pass/Fail 

o  Aide positions  
o  Peer tutoring  
o  SAT Prep Classes 
o 

 Driver’s Education  

•  College courses that are not approved dual credit courses  
•  Courses taken during Summer School, unless dual credit (GPA is always recorded for dual 

credit courses)  

•  World language courses taken concurrently outside normal school hours  
•  Credit by Exam/Exam for Acceleration (CBE/EA) 
•  Local Credits  
•  Distance learning courses unless the course receives prior district approval 

o  Frisco ISD Virtual Academy courses, online Chinese courses taken with Frisco ISD 

during the regular school day are included in the weighted GPA.

•  Credit by Exam/Exam for Acceleration (CBE/EA)  

  
Note that neither grade points nor credit will be awarded for summer enrichment programs. For the 
Class of 2023 and beyond students taking credit recovery courses online will receive GPA points. 
 
Optional GPA Exclusions (starting with the class of 2021) 
In order to encourage commitment and retention to a Fine Arts or Athletics program for a full four years 
and encourage participation in the upper level courses in these areas, students have the option to 
exclude from weighted GPA calculation one credit each year in grade 11 and grade 12. This allows 
juniors and seniors who are on track to meet all graduation requirements to participate in the following 
programs in the third and/or fourth year on a GPA exempt basis. This option should only be 
considered by students who have a weighted GPA of 5.0 or greater.  

 

The eligible single courses include the following: 
 
 

Theater/Tech Theater  
 
Band 
Choir 
 

 
 

 
 
*Not to include ensemble or Off Campus PE 

Dance/Drill Team 
Color Guard 
Orchestra  

 

 
 
 

 
 

Athletic Trainer 
Athletics/Manager` 

 

To exclude a course from weighted GPA calculation, students must have two years participation in the 
single program of interest in two previous school years during high school. Students must complete the 
”GPA Opt Out” by April 16  to request an exemption for the upcoming school year. The exemption form 
can be found on the student portal under the GPA Opt Out tile. Students may submit his or her 
exemption by the elective change deadline each spring. Students new to Frisco ISD may submit his or 
her request up to two weeks after receiving his or her first transcript with calculated GPA.  

 

*The GPA exemption only applies for areas of Fine Arts that do not contain options for weighted credit, 
thus Art is not an eligible area (Advanced and AP Art courses are available in the four-year pathways).

Valedictorian and Salutatorian Requirements  
Each district high school shall have a valedictorian and salutatorian. Candidates must be 8 semester 
graduates and in attendance at the awarding high school continuously, commencing with enrollment no 
later than the first day of the second nine-weeks marking period of the student’s junior year through 
graduation. The valedictorian shall be the eligible graduate with the highest GPA; the salutatorian shall 
be the eligible graduate with the second highest GPA. 
 
Honor Graduates  
Each level of Honor Graduates will be determined by the student’s weighted grade point average at the 
end of the 3rd quarter which will be no lower than 4.0 with no rounding. Honor Graduates will be 
denoted in the graduation program.  
 
Transfer Students  
Transfer Grades - Transcripts from within the United States 
When a transcript is received from an accredited school within the United States, credit and GPA points 
will be awarded following review by the school staff. All academic information (including course type 
and grades) must be noted on an official transcript. Report cards are not considered as official 
documents. Courses will be interpreted to Texas equivalency courses/credits and used to determine 
course sequencing. When letter grades are listed on the transcript, the information below will be used 
to determine the numerical equivalent. If a numerical range is listed on the transcript, the midpoint will 
be calculated and used. 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
               (If prior district awarded credit for a D, a ”P” will indicate credit.)  

71 for C- 
75 for C 
78 for C+ 

91 for A- 
95 for A 
98 for A+ 

81 for B- 
85 for B 
88 for B+ 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
All transferred credits will be calculated for GPA in accordance with FISD guidelines (see TRANSFER 
GRADES). Weighted GPA points for an advanced course will be awarded only if: 
 

● 

the course is recorded as advanced on an official Academic Achievement Record (AAR) 

 

and 
 

●  a comparable course was offered in FISD during the same school year.  

 
Transfer Grades - Transcripts from outside the United States 
Parents are responsible for providing a transcript translated into English if translation is required. 
Courses will be interpreted to Texas equivalency courses/credits and used to determine course 
sequencing. Transcripts from outside of the United States (except for accredited international schools 
offering Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or Cambridge curriculum or Department of 
Defense schools as described below) will not receive a letter grade or numerical equivalency. A “P” for 
passing will be assigned to designate that credit was earned, and GPA points are not awarded. The 
maximum number of transcribed course credits that may be awarded via transcript per school year is 
eight. Credit is awarded based on review by school staff. International schools accredited by US entities 
that offer Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or Cambridge curriculum as well as the 
Department of Defense schools will be reviewed in the same manner as transcripts received from 
accredited schools from within the United States. Credit and GPA points may be awarded following 
review by school staff. 
  
Credit for World Languages – See Althernative Methods for Earning Credit for additional World 
Language opportunities.

Grading System 
Student academic evaluation is achieved through the use of a grading system. An average grade of 70 
is required for successful completion of a course. The grading system of the Frisco Independent School 
District shall be in accordance with the following scale: 
 

A: 90-100 

 

B: 80-89 

 

C: 70-79 

 

F: Below 70 

 
If a student fails one semester, but passes the second semester of the same course, a student may 
gain credit for that semester if they “average pass” the course.  To average pass, the averages of the 
two semesters must be at or above 70%. First and second semester grades must average to a 70 or 
above to earn full credit. 
 
Each teacher is required to effectively communicate their grading standards to students and parents. 
Grade reports are posted each nine weeks, usually on the Friday following the end of the grading 
period. Progress reports to parents are posted at three-week intervals.  All FISD secondary schools 
participate in the Home Access Center, a web-based communications system that allows parents and 
students to obtain information online regarding the student’s current grades as well as assignment 
information.  Students and parents will be given instructions regarding utilization of this system at the 
beginning of the year.  
 
UIL Academic Eligibility 
High School 
In accordance with UIL eligibility policy and the Texas Education Agency, Frisco ISD has determined 
that any student who takes any advanced level IB or AP course for high school credit will automatically 
retain UIL eligibility for extracurricular activities including Athletics, Fine Arts, and Academic 
competitions regardless of their marking period grade.  
 
Additionally, advanced level courses listed below for high school credit will automatically retain UIL 
eligibility for extracurricular activities including Athletics, Fine Arts, and Academic competitions 
regardless of their marking period grade. 
High School Credit: 
Algebra I Advanced 
Geometry Advanced 
Algebra II Advanced 
Pre-Calculus Advanced 
English I, II Advanced  
Biology Advanced 
Chemistry Advanced 
Spanish II, III Advanced

other than English courses are exempt from the UIL eligibility requirements.  
 
Middle School 
Any student who takes an advanced level course that does not earn high school credit and is listed 
below will automatically retain UIL eligibility for extracurricular activities including Athletics, Fine Arts, 
and Academic competitions, if the grade earned at the first six week UIL eligibility checkpoint, or any 
subsequent nine week marking period is between a 60%-69%. A student who earns below a 60% at the

first six week UIL eligibility checkpoint, or any subsequent nine week marking period will be ineligible to 
participate in UIL activities until the next opportunity to regain UIL eligibility.   
 
The following courses are designated as advanced level courses for the purpose of retaining eligibility: 
Middle School Credit Only: 
Integrated Language Arts 6, 7, and 8 Advanced  
 
GT Integrated Language Arts 6, 7, and 8 Advanced  
Math 6, 7, and 8 Advanced 
Science 7 and 8 Advanced 
 
Frequently Asked Questions for 9-Weeks Grading Periods 
 
Philosophy of Assessment and Grading 
The goal of Frisco ISD’s assessment and grading system is to help ensure student mastery of the 
curriculum. The system exists to communicate student performance to all stakeholders.  

 
 

1.  Assessment: The purpose of assessment  is to provide timely and continuous feedback to 

students and parents in order to track progress, teachers in order to make instructional 
decisions regarding intervention/extension, and stakeholders in order to make 
placement/program decisions. 

 

2.  Grading: Grades serve as artifacts of learning and communicate what students know and 

are able to do for a wide variety of audiences including students, parents, school 
administrators, post-secondary institutions, and employers. Grades need to be a true 
reflection of the student’s relative level of mastery of content, knowledge, and skills. While 
grades are a final necessity for certain processes (gpa, rank), grades only represent a 
student’s understanding of a specific topic at a point in time.  

 
Student Information 
Classification of Students  
The following standards apply to grade classification. Standing is determined at the start of each school 
year. Classification is for the complete school year.   

 

●  Freshman (9th grader):  A student entering high school for the first time or having fewer than 6 

credits will be classified as a 9th grader. 

●  Sophomore (10th grader):  A student who has earned a minimum of 6 credits will be classified 

as a 10th grader. 

●  Junior (11th grader):  A student who has earned a minimum of 12 credits will be classified as 

an 11th grader. 

●  Senior (12th grader):  A student who has earned a minimum of 18 credits will be classified as a 

12th grader.  

Students who are enrolled in the correct number of credits to graduate in the current school year may 
also be classified as a senior with principal approval. 
 
Minimum Course Enrollment  
In order to qualify as a full-time student Frisco ISD students must be enrolled in at least the equivalent 
of 6 credit classes each semester, 5 of which must be state credits. Late arrival or early dismissal 
periods may be granted for 11th and 12th grade students if they are satisfactorily progressing toward 
graduation. All 9th and 10th grade students should be enrolled in eight class periods.

STAAR End of Course Exams (EOCs) 
All students in applicable courses will take STAAR End of Course (EOC) Assessments in accordance 
with state law.  Satisfactory performance on all EOCs is a graduation requirement.  Students not 
meeting satisfactory performance on EOCs will be given the opportunity to retest three times per year 
in accordance to the state testing calendar.  A four-hour time limit applies to Algebra I, Biology, and 
U.S. History.  A five-hour time limit applies to English I and English II.  
End of course exams occur in the late Spring. Dual credit students in HIST 1302 will take the EOC for 
US History in the December testing window.  
Middle school students enrolled in high school EOC tested courses will only be required to take the 
EOC assessment for the courses in which they are enrolled.  
 
The State acknowledges performance levels as the following: 
Masters Grade Level  
Meets Grade Level  
Approaches Grade Level  
Did Not Meet Grade Level  
 
Students Not Meeting “Approaches Grade Level” Standard on EOC 
The “Approaches Grade Level” standard is considered passing on each EOC. Additional academic 
support will be provided by the district for students failing to meet this standard for each assessment.  
Parents and students will receive information regarding additional support and test dates. Students may 
not be eligible for late arrival/early release as juniors and seniors if they have failed to meet the 
requirements of the STAAR assessment program. Individual Graduation Committees may be convened 
for students failing to approach grade level on two EOCs. 
 
8th Grade STAAR  
8th grade students must meet the Approaches Grade Level standard on both Math and Reading 
STAAR assessments.  When students do not meet the level within the three available testing 
administrations, the Grade Placement Committee, along with the parent and student will meet to 
determine a plan.  The committee determines whether to place the student in 9th grade and to develop 
a plan for accelerated instruction during the next school year to ensure the student meets the standards 
set for the 9th grade courses. The Grade Placement Committee may promote a student who they 
believe can achieve grade level performance with accelerated instruction within the ninth grade year. 
Accelerated instruction plans may include tutorials or intervention courses designed to provide students 
with the skills needed for success.

Career and Technical Education 
Mission & Purpose of Career and Technical Education 
The mission of Career and Technical Education is to prepare students to succeed in high demand 
occupations within the competitive global economy and to provide students with the academic skills 
necessary to continue their education in post-secondary schools. Career and Technical Education can 
help students explore their potential and establish future career goals. Students can use the CTE 
Pathways to choose courses that interest them and do not need to take every course listed under each 
grade level as there are many options within each program. 
 
The Career & Technical Education Center (CTEC) 
The Frisco ISD CTE Center houses advanced CTE courses for Frisco ISD high school students. 
Students will remain on their home campus for all coursework with the exception of the courses 
designated as (CTEC) which are taught at the Frisco ISD CTE Center.  
 
The Frisco ISD CTE Center allows students to explore postsecondary and career options with an 
industry-standard learning experience. Students are able to pursue an interest rather than make a life-
long commitment. This allows an opportunity for students to choose courses that truly interest them, 
providing a meaningful connection to the curriculum and school. Due to limitations in some field site 
placements and the competitive nature of the programs, completing the prerequisites does not 
guarantee a position in some of the advanced CTE Courses offered at the CTE Center.  
 
Programs at the Frisco ISD CTE Center may have fees associated with them for lab materials, 
supplies, student organization costs, industry-standard or professional certification examinations, and 
uniforms or standard dress requirements.  
 
Frisco ISD will provide transportation to and from the CTE Center during the instructional day. At times, 
CTE Center courses may conflict with non-academic activities on the home campus. Students will be 
expected to remain in their academic classes at the CTE Center. CTE Center students are also 
expected to maintain good attendance, behavior, and grades. 
 
 
For more information, visit the Frisco ISD CTE Center at  
http://schools.friscoisd.org/spc/cte or by phone at 469-633-6780.  
 
 
 
CTE Courses and Dual and Articulated College Credit 
The  intent  of  offering  dual  and  articulated  college  credit  is  to  provide  the  student  with  academic  and 
workplace  skills  that  will  allow  the  individual  to  successfully  enter  post-secondary  education,  the  job 
market, or the military. All students, including special populations and non-traditional populations, have 
equal access to all of these programs of study. Dual and articulated college credit encourages high skill 
attainment in both academic and technical areas and utilizes technology in the classroom.  
 
CTE Courses and Science Credit 
CTE Classes that count for FISD Graduation Credit as a 4th Science: 

•  Animal Science  
•  Advanced Plant & Soil Science  
•  Food Science 
•  Forensic Science 
•  Medical Microbiology

Dual Credit Courses 
General Information Regarding Dual Credit 

Frisco ISD offers dual credit opportunities with Collin College and the University of North Texas. 
Qualified students may be enrolled in a FISD High school and Collin College/University of North Texas 
for specified classes noted in the FISD Course Catalog. Students in dual credit courses earn both high 
school and college credit. Students must meet Collin College/University of North Texas admissions 
requirements and secure their high school counselor’s approval for the dual credit courses selected. 
The University of North Texas North Texas Now! dual credit program has limited enrollment and 
requires an admissions process. Students will follow a set course pathway that is designated as part of 
the program.  Please see http://www.friscoisd.org/departments/dual-credit/unt for additional information 
on the courses and the admissions process. Students must successfully complete the Texas Success 
Initiative Examination (TSI) or provide proof of exemption from TSI, and an A/B grade point average is 
recommended.  
 
Students are responsible for paying for tuition, books, and fees associated with Collin College and 
University of North Texas dual credit courses. For Collin College dual credit students receiving free or 
reduced lunch, scholarships for both tuition and books are available. 
 
Registration and payment deadlines for dual credit differ from Collin College registration timelines. 
In addition, FISD does not approve dual credit for accelerated college courses (i.e. wintermester, 
maymester, 8-week core courses, etc.) Students should meet with their school counselor if interested in 
dual credit and reference http://www.friscoisd.org/departments/dual-credit/home for registration 
deadlines and application information. 
 
If a student fails a dual credit course with a grade 0-69%, he or she may not remain enrolled in that 
same subject for dual credit at Collin College or the University of North Texas. Every effort will be made 
to enroll the student in the same content area upon return to their home campus the following 
semester. However, there may be instances where that course is not offered on the campus and the 
student must complete a different course for graduation. The course may incur a fee if an online course 
is the only option for either credit recovery or original credit. This is the same process for a student who 
chooses to drop or withdraw from a course. A student may stay enrolled in dual credit courses for which 
they are eligible and have not yet received a 0-69% in that subject area. Students who earn 60-69% in 
a dual credit course will be awarded college credit, but not high school credit. Students will have to 
either sit in the regular class, if that is an option, or purchase an online alternative to make up the credit. 
Students receiving a 59% or lower will not receive high school or college credit. 
 
If a student withdraws from a college course, the student can be placed in a similar on-level course on 
campus. However, if the student withdraws without telling their home campus and does not report to 
school they will need to complete the entire course from the beginning. This may incur a fee if they 
have to take the course online through The Frisco R.A.I.L. (Reaching All Innovative Learners, the 
Frisco ISD online learning program) or through another approved online provider. Students who are 
removed from the regular school setting and assigned to an alternative educational placement may be 
required to drop the dual credit courses and incur any penalities or fees associated with dropping. 
For more information about Dual Credit, please see FISD website: 
http://www.friscoisd.org/departments/dual-credit/home 
If at any time a student is not allowed to come to campus, they will not be able to keep their dual credit 
classes in their schedule. Students that take dual credit inside of their school day and who are then 
reassigned to DAEP will not be able to finish their courses on campus. If the transfer happens prior to 
the colleges drop period we may be able to move the student to the same course on the campus if the 
professor approves. If not, the student will be moved to an FISD on-level course. This may mean that a 
student loses their payment to the college and may incur a failing grade on their college transcript.  If a 
student taking dual credit course is reassigned to a juvenile justice system they will have to level down

Alternative Methods for Earning Credit 
All alternative methods of earning credit that are completed during the school day adhere to UIL rules 
and guidelines as well as the TEA-UIL Side-by-Side (No Pass No Play) academic policies. 
 
Distance Learning & Correspondence for Original Credit 
Supplemental coursework should be completed through Frisco ISD programs unless the course is not 
available. Any distance (online) or correspondence courses must be pre-approved by the campus 
counselor in order for the student to receive credit. This allows the student to receive academic 
advisement and ensures that students take courses that are aligned to our FISD scope and sequence. 
Additionally, students in the class of 2024 and beyond will have these courses included in their GPA. 
No courses will be accepted by Frisco ISD unless students complete the required pre-approval 
process. Students and parents/guardians can access the form to gain pre-approval in the Student 
portal. Please provide at least two weeks to complete the pre-approval process.  Once pre-approval 
has been received, the counselor will advise you on the registration process for any distance (online) or 
correspondence course. Students will not be approved to take a high school credit course until students 
have demonstrated successful completion of 8th grade coursework. 
 
No courses will be accepted by Frisco ISD unless students complete the required pre-approval 
process. Pre-approval from your campus counselor guarantees that the appropriate courses are 
selected to meet graduation requirements and that the courses are aligned to the Frisco ISD scope and 
sequence. Additionally, students in the class of 2024 and beyond will have these courses included in 
their GPA calculation.The pre-approval process ensures equity regarding GPA calculations and course 
inclusion. Limited providers are accepted for Frisco ISD credit. These providers are currently limited to: 
 

•  Texas Tech 
•  University of Texas 
•  Texas Virtual School Network 
•  Frisco ISD RAIL courses 

 
Coursework from non-approved providers will not count for credit toward graduation. Courses for credit 
must be successfully completed in full and transcripts received prior to the start of the semester or else 
the student will be enrolled in the appropriate course. 
 
World Language Alternative Credit 
Students may also seek a maximum of two credits for the purpose of meeting graduation requirements 
in languages not offered by the district. These courses must be from an accredited school within the 
United States and must meet specific criteria in order to be approved by the district World Language 
coordinator. Courses must be taken outside of normal school hours. Students with graduation dates of 
2024 and beyond must provide documentation of grades along with the transcript in order for GPA 
points to be awarded. GPA points will not be awarded to students graduating prior to 2024. 
 
The Frisco R.A.I.L: Reaching All Innovative Learners 
Online educational opportunities have expanded dramatically in the last several years. Frisco ISD is 
excited to begin our own supplementary online program to help students with flexible scheduling and 
personalized learning. Each course requires counselor approval and compulsory attendance still 
applies.  This is a supplemental online program that allows students to catch-up to graduate with their 
cohort or accelerate to make room for preferred academic courses.  
 
For the most updated information please visit the R.A.I.L website:

Credit Recovery 
Credit Recovery Guidelines 
The goal of the Frisco ISD Credit Recovery Program is to assist students deficient in credits while at the 
same time preserving the integrity of the FISD diploma. FISD will ensure that every student has the 
opportunity to acquire the credits necessary to earn a diploma. It is the responsibility of each student to 
be aware of their progress toward a diploma and to take full advantage of the assistance available.  
Students who may potentially be candidates for athletic scholarships should be advised that credits 
earned through credit recovery may not qualify for minimum core course requirements under NCAA 
guidelines.   See the following link for specific information:   http://www.ncaa.org/student-
athletes/future/nontraditional-courses 
 
High school students who fail a course may recover credit through the following options: 

•  Academy Courses during the school day - If a student has failed 2 courses they may have 
the opportunity to take online credit recovery for free during the school day.  Students should 
speak with their counselor. 

•  R.A.I.L. - Students may purchase credit recovery or original credit courses through the R.A.I.L 

program that are taught by Frisco ISD teachers and follow the Frisco ISD curriculum. 

•  Summer School - Summer school is online and students may purchase credit recovery and 

some original credit classes. 

•  Repeating the class during the school day - Students with scores below 50 may consider 

taking the class again in a regular classroom. 

•  Credit by Examination - At certain times students may purchase a CBE to show proof of 

mastery of content.  Please see the section that explains this process. 

•  Outside Providers - FISD uses TXVSN for coursework that we do not yet provide.  A student 

may reach out to the TXVSN coordinator for options available.  These courses vary in cost.  

 
Failing online grades are placed on a student’s transcript and beginning class of 2023 credit recovery 
grades including summer will calculate into GPA.  
 
Fifth year students: 
Fifth year students may be referred to the Student Opportunity Center to complete graduation 
requirements. 
 
The following information pertains to all grade levels: 

●  Any cost associated with Credit Recovery option will be the responsibility of the student and 

parent. 

●  Students attending the Student Opportunity Center credit acceleration program during the 

school day will be provided with transportation to and from the student’s home campus to the 
SOC by the district. Parents and students will be responsible for transportation for all other 
credit recovery classes taken at the SOC.   

●  Seniors planning to participate in graduation must provide proof of credit earned and recorded 
at least 5 school days before graduation. All other students must provide proof of credit prior to 
the start of the following school year in order to receive credit that would result in promotion to 
the next grade level. Reclassification is only done each year prior to the start of the school. 

●  Students must seek prior approval from appropriate campus staff before enrolling in any of the 

credit recovery options. 

●  Students should refer to existing guidelines for details regarding correspondence, credit by 

exam, summer school, night school or online courses. 

●  Final decisions regarding placement in credit recovery rest with the campus principal.

Credit Through Testing  
Students can earn credit in two slightly different ways by taking examinations:  

1.  Exam for Acceleration (EA): provides an opportunity to earn grade level or course credit in 

which no prior formal instruction was completed.  Students must demonstrate mastery of 80% or 
higher on an EA to earn credit. 

2.  Credit by Exam (CBE): utilized to earn credit for a course, when a student has had prior 

instruction.  Students must demonstrate mastery of 70% or higher on a CBE to earn credit. 
 

After successful completion of a CBE or an EA taken for high school credit, the numerical score earned 
will be posted to the student’s high school transcript, and the student will earn high school credit for the 
course When course credit is earned through testing, average pass does not apply. Students must earn 
a passing score for each semester to earn credit for the course and have the grades transcripted. The 
transcripted credit will not be calculated into the student’s grade point average (GPA) for ranking 
purposes. For middle school courses, the student’s CBE or EA numerical score will be documented in 
the student’s permanent academic record. Scores not meeting the passing standard are documented in 
the student’s high school transcript or middle school permanent record with “NG.” 
 
Exam for Acceleration - Without Prior Instruction  
High school students who wish to earn credit for a course in which they have had no prior formal 
instruction may test for credit.  Examinations for Grade 9-12 are criterion-referenced tests from Frisco 
ISD, Texas Tech University, University of Texas, Avant Assessment (all World Language Assessment) 
or the testing instruments approved by the Superintendent or designee.  Students will not be approved 
to take a high school credit course until students have demonstrated successful completion of 8th 
grade coursework. Students are encouraged to review the course study guide on the university 
website. If a student fails to achieve the designated score for a subject before the beginning of the 
school year in which the student would ordinarily be required to enroll in that subject, the student must 
satisfactorily complete the course to receive credit.   
 
Exams for Acceleration are not offered for courses in which students are currently enrolled and 
receiving prior instruction. During mid-year windows, such as November and January, students would 
not be able to receive adequate instruction  to gain credit in the subsequent course. The mid-year 
windows are used for one-semester courses and world languages. Assessment Guidelines online offer 
additional information. 
 
No exam results will be accepted by Frisco ISD unless the students complete the district application 
process (for district testing) or the required pre-approval process (for outside testing). Applications are 
available from the school counselor and must be submitted by the parent by the deadline posted on the 
Frisco ISD website to gain pre-approval. Please provide at least two weeks to complete the pre-
approval process. Once pre-approval has been received, the counselor will advise you on the 
registration process for acceleration testing.Parents should be aware that there are no exceptions 
available for students to test for acceleration and plan accordingly. Students may test at any time during 
the testing window, but must be registered by the test application deadline. A student may take a 
specific examination only once during each window. The application deadline and testing window will 
be determined at the start of each school year and can be found at: 
http://www.friscoisd.org/departments/testing/acceleration-credit-by-exam

No exams will be accepted by Frisco ISD unless students complete the required pre-approval 
process. Pre-approval from your campus counselor guarantees that the appropriate exams are 
selected and that pre-requisites and all requirements of Texas Education Code (TEC) §74.24 are met. 
Limited providers are accepted for Frisco ISD exams for acceleration. These providers are currently 
limited to: 
 

•  Texas Tech 
•  University of Texas 
•  Frisco ISD 
•  Avant Assessment (World Languages Only) 

 
Exams from non-approved providers will not count for credit toward graduation. Exams must be 
completed and official scores received prior to the start of the semester or else the student will be 
enrolled in the appropriate course. 
 
Students who may potentially be candidates for athletic scholarships should be advised that credits 
earned through this method may not qualify for minimum core course requirements under NCAA 
guidelines. See the following link for specific information: 
http://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes/future/nontraditional-courses 
 
Credit by Examination - With Prior Instruction 
Students, under certain circumstances, may be able to take credit by exam for a course in which they 
have had prior instruction but did not receive credit. This option must be approved by the campus 
principal (or designee). This option generally applies to students who have not earned credit due to 
extenuating circumstances such as a family move, illness, etc. To be eligible for a credit by exam, a 
student must have had prior instruction in the course. It also may apply to students who were 
homeschooled or attended a non-accredited private school and need state approved credit. Students 
who attended school in a foreign country where students were taught in a language other than English 
may also qualify to test that language (French, Spanish, German) with prior instruction. Students are 
encouraged to review the admission requirements for universities before choosing the credit by exam 
option. Students who may potentially be candidates for athletic scholarships should be advised that 
credits earned through credit by exam may not qualify for minimum core course requirements under 
NCAA guidelines. See the following link for specific information: http://www.ncaa.org/student-
athletes/future/nontraditional-courses 
 
Applications are available from the school counselor and must be submitted by the parent electronically 
by the deadline posted on the Frisco ISD website. There is a fee of $45-$50 (depending on exam) for 
each semester exam. Students may test at any time during the testing window, but must be registered 
by the test application deadline. The application deadline and testing window will be determined at the 
start of each school year and can be found at :

What is “Prior Instruction?” 
“Prior Instruction” is constituted by  

•  Course grade on a transcript below 70 
•  Transcripted credit from a non-accredited organization 
•  Credit lost due to excessive absences 

o  Students that have missed 25% or more days per semester 

•  Prior instruction may also be considered if a student has attended 90% or more of a semester 

but was not able to complete in entirety

Computer Science Substitutes for World Language Credit  
In 2013 the Texas Legislature provided the graduation requirement option of substituting two credits 
in computer programming language for two credits of a language other than English (LOTE). The State 
Board of Education designated specific courses to fulfill this requirement which include the following 
courses offered to all FISD students:  
  

Computer Science 1    
Computer Science Advanced                           AP Computer Science A  
Computer Science III Advanced  

AP Computer Science Principles  

 

 

 
Students may earn a maximum of two World Language (LOTE) credits through these designated 
computer science courses to fulfill graduation requirements. Students should also be aware of 
university admission requirements when making the decision to forgo LOTE courses as many 
universities require forgeign language credit.

may sign up for either late arrival or early release. Students who opt for either must have transportation 
and may not be on campus when they are not scheduled in a class. Third period release is only 
available to students in dual credit zero hour and/or fourth period. 
 
Special Education 
Students experiencing difficulties in school may be referred for services in special education. Before a 
student can receive special education and/or related services for the first time, an initial evaluation must 
be conducted. Decisions regarding the provision of special education services are made by an 
Admission, Review, and Dismissal (ARD)committee. If a student is determined to be eligible for 
services in accordance with the Texas Education Agency guidelines, an individualized education plan is 
developed. Instruction that is designed to meet a student’s unique educational needs may be provided 
in a variety of settings. Instructional settings may include (a) general education classroom with 
accommodations, (b) general education classroom with support, (c) resource classroom, (d) self-
contained classroom, or (e) a separate campus. Related services necessary for the student to benefit 
from special education may also be provided. 
 
Virtual Academy Courses 
In accordance with guidance from the Texas Education Agency, Frisco ISD provided most of the 
courses listed in the course catalog in both a face to face and virtual setting during the 20-21 school 
year.  As of December 1, 2020, the Texas Education Agency has not communicated requirements for 
school districts regarding the 21-22 school year.  After Frisco ISD receives information regarding the 
Texas Education Agency requirements and reviews options, additional information regarding the 
possibility of virtual courses will be communicated.  Students are advised to move forward with their 
course selection on the assumption that the classes will be held in a face to face format.

Advanced Programs and Gifted and Talented 

AP® Exam Dates 
Advanced placement exams are typically administered the first two weeks of May.  Exam Registration 
information will be updated at the beginning of each school year. Please see the updated dates and 
guidelines at our website: http://www.friscoisd.org/departments/advanced-academics/advanced-
placement  
 
Advanced Programs 
Advanced Courses 
Advanced courses provide motivated students the opportunity to learn course content with increased 
academic depth and complexity.  Advanced courses parallel the curriculum offered in an on level class 
but may cover additional topics or provide greater depth in certain topics or skills.  However, all of the 
Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills will be covered. Frisco ISD is strongly committed to providing 
equity and access within the Advanced Academics programming.  All Advanced courses are open 
enrollment and we encourage any motivated student to take an Advanced course based on their 
interests and goals. Advanced courses better prepare students for the increased rigor of AP courses. 
 
AP (Advanced Placement) Courses 
The AP® Program allows students to participate in rigorous, college level courses while still in high 
school. AP courses follow the curriculum framework outlined by the College Board and also cover all of 
the corresponding Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills.  At the end of the course, students are 
encouraged to take the corresponding AP exam that is given in May of each school year.  Upon 
successful completion of an AP® exam, students can earn college credit at most universities and 
colleges.  Students may receive college credit at any public university or college in Texas based on AP 
exam scores. Students may confirm college credit offered at 
https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement/search-credit-policies.  
 
Additionally, many selective universities and colleges review AP coursework and exam scores as part 
of the college admissions process.  Frisco ISD is strongly committed to providing equity and access 
within the Advanced Academics programming.  All AP courses are open enrollment and we encourage 
any motivated student to take an AP course based on their interests and goals. Counselors and current 
teachers can help students make informed decisions on the appropriate level course work.

Gifted and Talented Services 
The high school gifted student is served through GT Humanities I/ English I Advanced in ninth grade 
and GT Humanities II/ AP World History in tenth grade. The GT Humanities courses cover world history 
content over two years and prepare students for the AP World History exam.  In 11th grade, students 
receiving GT services may take double-blocked GT American Studies which provides them AP English 
Language and Composition and AP US History credit and prepares them for the corresponding AP 
exams.  Specific subject advanced placement courses and fine arts electives also provide challenge 
and enrichment for these students. Presentation and research projects are important components of 
advanced placement classes.   http://www.friscoisd.org/departments/gifted-education/home 
 
International Baccalaureate (IB) 
Frisco ISD is undergoing the authorization process in order to implement the International 
Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme (DP) starting with the Class of 2023.  The IB Diploma 
Programme is a rigorous, college preparatory program that includes high level coursework in six 
different subject areas and additional IB components that students complete in the 11th and 12th 
grades. The district-wide program is available to students in all attendance zones within the district and 
will be housed at Frisco High School. Each fall, the Advanced Academics department will host 
informational nights prior to start of the admissions process. If there is more student interest than spots 
available in the program, a lottery system will be utilized to select students. Students who are selected 
for the IB Diploma Programme will transfer to FHS in the 9th grade.  To learn more about the IB 
Diploma Programme, visit www.ibo.org or contact the FHS IB Coordinator.

Using the Course Catalog: 
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th Credit Options 
For ease of use, the catalog has been divided into sections of the most common courses needed by 
class. This should be seen as a feature to make the Catalog easier to navigate and less overwhelming, 
and not a substitute for prerequisite/grade level. 
 
Prerequisites and Grade Levels 
Please note grade and prerequisites with each course description. All prerequisites listed must be met 
and passed prior to beginning a course. Grade levels listed with each course serve as a guide to 
appropriate course sequence, though some courses do have a required age or grade level. Counselor 
approval is necessary to take courses outside of the grade level designation. 
 
Committee Recommendation Courses 
Frisco ISD provides leveled versions of academic courses and electives to meet the programming and 
curriculum needs of all students within our district. With the exception of our dual credit, advanced, and 
college preparation courses, all on-level academic courses described within this guide are linked with 
Principles and Applied versions of the courses. The Principles courses are based on content learning 
standards directly related to the course TEKS, modified for the student access to the curriculum. The 
Applied courses are based on prerequisite skills to the TEKS based learning standards. Applied 
courses are designed to focus on the critical need areas for functional academics and real-world 
application to the student’s individualized needs. Student access and placement in an Applied or 
Principles course is met through an ARD committee meeting decision and agreement. The Principles 
and Applied courses carry the same graduation credit and pre-requisites as their on-level counterparts.
